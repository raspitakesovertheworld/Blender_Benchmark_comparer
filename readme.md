# Blender Benchmark Comparer

by Markus Bawidamann
<br />

**Blender Benchmark is great!**

Finally a operating system / hardware agnostic real life benchmarking tool based on a real workload.

**BUT...**

the website <br />
**opendata.blender.org/**

does not show you much and has very little tools to display the 270'000+ benchmarks in a meaningful way.
There is just a top ten fastest systems, which is not that useful.

The purpose of this tool is to allow you to display and compare the run benchmarks in a more meaningful way.

It displays Top 10, Top 50, Top 100, Top 250, Top 500

The benchmark comparer focuses only on one Blender scene: Pavillion, as it is one of the larger scenes.
The uncompresssed opendata source file is too large and is therefore not stored on github, but uncompressed locally.

Currently, this is just a python CLI tool, but a GUI is planned.
